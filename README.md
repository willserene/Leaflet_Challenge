# Visualization of Earthquakes Around the World

## About

Using Leaflet, an interactive map was created to plots all of the earthquakes around the world using data from the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php). 

Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and depth of the earth quake by color
